<h1 style="color:grey;">WHAT IS A WORD PROCESSOR ?</h1>
<p>A word processor is a device or software program capable of creating, storing, and printing text documents. It allows users to write and modify text, display it on a screen, save it electronically, and print it out.

Word processing software is one of the most common technology tools in the world, allowing users to create resumes and cover letters, business correspondence, blog posts, novels, and more.

Traditionally, word processors were computer applications downloaded to a specific number of computers. But as cloud computing has become more common, so have browser-based word processors. These typically lack the more advanced features of a traditional program; however, they offer more flexibility and the ability to collaborate in real time.</p>
<h2 style="color:indigo;">Some best word processor are</h2>
<h2 style="color:LightSkyBlue;">Microsoft Word</h2>
<p style="color:LightSkyBlue;">Used to make professional-quality documents, letters, reports, etc., MS Word is a word processor developed by Microsoft. It has advanced features which allow you to format and edit your files and documents in the best possible way. </p>
<h2 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">LIBRE OFFICE</h2>
<p style="color:DarkTurquoise;">finally we come to a full-fledged word processor that offers offline desktop apps and is totally available for free. LibreOffice is an open-source project that is compatible with Microsoft Word and other Office documents. It aims to bring all the powerful tools and features of popular word processors in a slick and modern user interface â€” all for free.Besides that, what gives LibreOffice the edge is that its code is much better optimized, thus making it lighter and faster. Also, LibreOffice is more actively developed and is the default office suite included with the majority of Linux distros. And just recently LibreOffice 7.1 was released with support for better compatibility with DOC/DOCX file format and new table and writing features. I would say, if you want a free word processor in 2022 that has desktop-level tools and features then LibreOffice is simply the best out there.</p>
